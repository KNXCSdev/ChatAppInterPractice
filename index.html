        Samuel Green Available to Walk That sounds great. I’d be happy with that. Could you send
        over some pictures of your dog, please? Here are a few pictures. She’s a happy girl! Can you
        make it? She looks so happy! The time we discussed works. How long shall I take her out for?

          Stay in touch with our dog walkers through the chat interface. This makes it easy to
          discuss arrangements and make bookings. Once the walk has been completed you can rate your
          walker and book again all through the chat.
